Here, start loop from left most to right, and multiply our cnt, every time if we found 1 then add to answer.

unsigned int Solution::reverse(unsigned int A) {
    unsigned int ans = 0, cnt = 1;
    for(int i = 31 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
        if((A >> i) & 1 ){
            ans += cnt;
        }
        cnt = (cnt << 1);
    }
    return ans;
}


2.

unsigned int Solution::reverse(unsigned int A) {
    unsigned int B = 0; //B will hold the reversed number
    for(int i=0;i<32;i++){  //Iterating on all bit positions
        int k = A & 1;      //Extracting the rightmost bit from A (the ith bit in original number)
        B <<= 1;            //Shifting B to left (rightmost bit becomes 0)
        B |= k;             //Adding the extracted bit
        A >>= 1;            //Now the (i+1)st bit shifts to the rightmost position in A
    }
    return B;
}
